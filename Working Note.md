I really want to try out cooking with Claude / Claude Code. Basically generating recipes based on a list of available ingredients. Take a look at this https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/23/cooking-with-claude/#atom-everything example and try it out. Then either add a note here or write a short blog post about the process. Maybe even connect this to my soon available recipes.marc-julian.com website.
