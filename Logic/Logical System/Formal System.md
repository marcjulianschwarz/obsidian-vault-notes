# Formal System

We call $\langle\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{K}, \models, \vdash\rangle$ a formal system if $\mathcal{S}=\langle\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{K}, \models\rangle$ is a [[Logical System]] and the relation $\vdash$ is a [[Derivation Relation]] for $\mathcal{S}$.

We can use [[Calculus-Derivation]] to create [[Proof|proofs]] in such a system.

[[Logical System]] + [[Derivation Relation]] = [[Formal System]]
