# First-Order Predicate Logic with Equality

We extend [[First-Order Predicate Logic]] with a new symbol for euqality $=\in\Sigma^p_2$ and have its [[Interpretation Function]] be
$$\mathcal{I}(=):=\left\{(x, x) \mid x \in \mathcal{D}_\iota\right\}$$
and call this logic first-order logic with equality $PL_=^1$
