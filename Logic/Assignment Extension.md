# Assignment Extension

Let there be a [[Variable Assignment]] $\varphi$ into the [[Universe]] and $a\in \mathcal{D}$ then the extension of $\varphi$ with $[a/X]$ (a for X) is defined as:

$$\{(Y, a) \in \varphi \mid Y \neq X\} \cup\{(X, a)\}: \varphi,[a / X]$$
The extension coincides with $\varphi$ off $X$, and gives $a$ there instead.
