# Consistency Test

When defining an [[Ontologien|Ontology]] one should make sure that there are no impossible/empty [[Concept|concepts]].
You can test if a [[Concept Definition]] is satisfiable with this kind of test and thus there will not be an empty [[Concept]].

We can use the [[Propositional Logic|propositional]] satisfiability tests:

- [[Analytical Tableaux]]
- [[Resolution Calculus|Resolution]]

They are [[Nondeterministic Polynomial Time Complete|NPC]], so most of the time exponential.
