Have a single note in your vault that is called "Working Note". Use this note as a scratchpad to explore ideas, write down thoughts, recombine older notes and to come up with new things.

Then, when necessary move those artifacts out of the working note by creating new smaller notes, linking older notes or expanding existing ones. 

The working note is temporary and always in a state of change. It serves as an inbox, a work bench and as a seed to grow new ideas and understandings.

I even have one here: [[Working Note]]. But don't expect too much from it. The content will always change and it might be hard to follow/comprehend.
