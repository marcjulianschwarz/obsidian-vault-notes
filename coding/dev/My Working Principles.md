## Meetings

> [!TIP]
> **Meetings should be dialogues, not monologues!**

- Status Update -> Write a ~~mail~~ chat message
- Deliver Information -> Write a mail
- Complexity, Collaboration, Emotion -> Schedule a meeting

### Meetings might not even be needed

Write it down, debate and argue in text so anyone interested can see what's going on. There's your minutes, your agenda, your invite for future ones right there.

Example: Linux kernel was entirely built over email.

### Takes on meetings 

> They're just corporate-sanctioned babysitting exercises. 

Agree with this quote from Hackernews for many types of meetings. Very rarely are they actually needed.


### Brainstorming meetings

If they don't happen **in person** with a **small** selection of **experts** it 

## Decisions

Document major decisions and their effect on your work.


## Getting back into the flow

- leave syntax errors in the code when clocking out in the evening 
- put TODO comments everywhere when developing a feature, then make sure there are none left when asking for review


## Work Life Balance 

It is also a good idea to place the hobby part of programming in a related but not same field/tech stack than you day job. If you simply do more work in your free time you might burn out. You want something that provides relaxation but still synergy effects with your day job.
