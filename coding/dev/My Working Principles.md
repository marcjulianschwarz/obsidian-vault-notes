## Products

I want to **care** about my products. About every single bit of it. Even in the parts that might not seem obvious at first or are hidden for the actual user. There should be no rough edges, everything should fit in. (of course not in a prototype).

> **Jony Ive’s** interview notes argue that meaningful design comes from caring about people and unseen details, prioritizing intimate, real-world collaboration over speed, and believing true quality shows up in what isn’t immediately visible.

## Meetings

> [!TIP]
> Meetings should be **dialogues**, not monologues!

- Status Update -> Write a ~~mail~~ chat message
- Deliver Information -> Write a mail
- Complexity, Collaboration, Emotion -> Schedule a meeting

### Meetings might not even be needed

Write it down, debate and argue in text so anyone interested can see what's going on. There's your minutes, your agenda, your invite for future ones right there.

Example: Linux kernel was entirely built over email.

### Takes on meetings 

> They're just corporate-sanctioned babysitting exercises. 

Agree with this quote from Hackernews for many types of meetings. Very rarely are they actually needed.

### Brainstorming meetings

If they don't happen **in person** with a **small** selection of **experts** this type of meeting is questionable.

## Decisions

Document major decisions and their effect on your work.


## Getting back into the flow

- leave syntax errors in the code when clocking out in the evening 
- put TODO comments everywhere when developing a feature, then make sure there are none left when asking for review

## Work Life Balance 

It is also a good idea to place the hobby part of programming in a related but not same field/tech stack than you day job. If you simply do more work in your free time you might burn out. You want something that provides relaxation but still synergy effects with your day job.

> OSS is your legacy! If you write proprietary code, everything you do dies with that company. I certainly don't want my life's work locked away like that. Working on OSS means a better chance to put the engineering first and do something that will last.

--> Contribute more to open source projects or at least to hobby projects that exist across job changes.

## On leaving jobs
