Zero Bug Policy
You will have to fix the bug eventually, so why not do it immediately?

Apparently Linear is running something like that where most bugs get fixed and deployed in under 24h.

I want to achieve a similar policy for my own projects and my day-to-day work. Or at least get back to bugs in that time, then batch them together and handle the batches as quick as possible.
