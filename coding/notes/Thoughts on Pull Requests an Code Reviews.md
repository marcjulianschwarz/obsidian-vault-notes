## LLM Generated Code

- unnecessary comments
- emojis in comments and debug logs 
- duplicated code
- not honoring naming conventions 

## Self-Review

- let me catch things I usually can't find

## PR Descriptions

Minimally, I would like **context** for the change, **why** it required a change to this part of the codebase, and the **thought process** behind the change.


## Code Review

- treat as high priority 
- start immediately and take your time 
- the absolute maximum turnaround on a review round should be one business day
- start high level (refactors, architecture, etc.) and work your way down during review rounds to lower level changes (variable naming, file naming, style issues, etc.)
