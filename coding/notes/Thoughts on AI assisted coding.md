There's this concept in aviation of "ahead of or behind the plane". When you're ahead of the plane, you understand completely what it's doing and why, and you're literally thinking in front of it. When you're behind the plane, it has done something expected and you are literally thinking behind it.

I think about coding assistants like this as well.

When I'm "ahead of the code," I know what I intend to write, why I'm writing it that way, etc. I have an intimate knowledge of both the problem space and the solution space I'm working in. But when I use a coding assistant, I feel like I'm "behind the code" - the same feeling I get when I'm reviewing a PR. I may understand the problem space pretty well, but I have to basically pick up the pieced of the solution presented to me, turn them over a bunch, try to identify why the solution is shaped this way, if it actually solves the problem, if it has any issues large or small, etc.
