# Autonomy

Direct consequence of [[Rational Behavior|Rationality]]. The [[Environment]] is _not_ known before, thus includes learning of the [[Environment]] and the properties, consequences, etc. of an [[Rational Agent|Agents]] [[Action|actions]].

Autonomy avoids fixed or static behavior. Can get challenging in a [[Dynamic Environment]].

An [[Rational Agent|Agent]] is autonomous when no prior knowledge about the [[Environment]] is needed.
