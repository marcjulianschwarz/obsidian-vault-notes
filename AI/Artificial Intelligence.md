# Artificial Intelligence

There are three major approaches to [[Artificial Intelligence]]
- [[Symbolic AI]]
- [[Statistical AI]]
- [[Subsymbolic AI]]


- [[AI as Rational Agents]]
	- [[Propositional Logic]].
	- [[First-Order Predicate Logic]]
	- [[Knowledge Representation]]
	- [[ALC]]
	- [[Planning]]
- [[Rational Non-Deterministic Agents]]

> [!EXAMPLE] Alternative AI Definition
>
> - Artificial Intelligence (AI) studies how we can make the computer do things that humans can still do better at the moment.
> - Once AI solves a subfield it is called computer science.
> - Doing things better than humans
>   - Systems that
>     - think like humans → [[Cognitive Science]], how does the brain work?
>     - think rationally → [[Logic]], formalization of knowledge, inference, planning, constraint..., what is the right way of thinking?
>     - act like humans → Turing Test
>     - act rationally → Contains Logic, making good choices in practice (doing the right thing), [[Rational Behavior]], [[Rational Agent]]

**Possible components of AI:**

- the ability to learn
- inference
- perception
- language understanding
  - related: [[Natural Language Processing]]
- emotion

Automated Reasoning, Automated Theorem Proving
Automatically verify / proof correctness of programms. For example Intel verifies all chips after "_Pentium 5 Disaster_".


**The AlphaGo Approach:**
[[Symbolic AI]] → Search Space → Use NN ([[Subsymbolic AI]]) to search through this search space

Producer Tasks → [[Symbolic AI]]
Consumer Tasks → [[Subsymbolic AI]]
