# Just be bored and you will level up 

The idea behind this is that when you are bored and literally doing nothing, your dopamin level is going to shrink to a base level where it usually is not. 
After being bored for long enough this will feel uncomfortable and you will want to do something.

Now make sure that you have you phone and other stuff far away and just let youself do whatever you want. For example, read a book, play guitar, go for a walk, write something down, code a bit, whatever... and all those activities will up your dopamin level without you getting sucked into any media on your phone, so when you are done, you will have done something meaningful and can go back to you work or whatever other important thing you did before you got bored.
