# Summary of My Working Principles

## Meetings
Meetings should be dialogues rather than monologues. Replace status updates with chat messages, and use emails for delivering information. Schedule meetings when dealing with complexity, collaboration, or emotions.

### Alternatives to Meetings
Often, meetings are unnecessary. Written debates can replace them, allowing everyone to see the ongoing discussion. This approach offers transparency and efficiency, similar to how the Linux kernel was developed via email.

### Brainstorming
Brainstorming is most effective in-person with a small group of experts. Otherwise, its value is questionable.

## Decisions
Document major decisions and their impacts to maintain clarity in work processes.

## Getting Back into the Flow
Leaving syntax errors or TODO comments in code can help re-engage with work more smoothly after breaks, ensuring nothing is missed during reviews.

## Work-Life Balance
It’s beneficial to pursue programming hobbies in fields related to, but not the same as, one's day job to avoid burnout and maintain balance.
