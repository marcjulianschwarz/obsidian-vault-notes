# Connectivity

- a [[Weg|path]] connects two vertices
- an [[Ungerichteter Graph|undirected graph]] is called connected if every pair of distinct vertices in the [[Graph]] is connected; otherwise, it is called disconnected.
- an [[Ungerichteter Graph|undirected graph]] is called k-vertex-connected or k-edge-connected if no [[set]] of k-1 vertices, respectively edges, exists that, when removed, disconnects the [[Graph]]
- a k-vertex-connected [[Graph]] is often called k-connected.
- a [[Gerichteter Graph|directed graph]] is called weakly connected if the corresponding [[Ungerichteter Graph|undirected graph]] is connected.
- it is strongly connected or strong if it contains a directed [[Weg|path]] from u to v and a directed [[Weg|path]] from v to u for every pair of vertices u,Â v.
