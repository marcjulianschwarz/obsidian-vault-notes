# InfoVis Chapter 2 - Multivariate Data

For a [[Multivariate Dataset]] it is important to do some [[Data Preparation]] which includes:

- [[Data Cleaning]]
- [[Data Reduction]]
- [[Data Transformation]]
- [[Data Discretization]]

One row in a table is called [[Entity|Observation]].

### Visualization techniques for Multivariate Data

See â†’ [[Data Visualization]]

The [[Parallel Coordinate Plot]] can be used to plot both numerical and [[Categorical Data]] at the same time which can be quite handy when plotting a [[Multivariate Dataset]].

A generalization of the [[Scatter Plot]] is the [[Scatter Plot Matrices|Scatter Plot Matrix]] which is being used to find [[Korrelation|Correlation]] between numerical attributes.

The [[Parallel Sets Plot]] is a technique to visualize multivariate [[Categorical Data]] by color and proportion. Similar to [[Histogram]].

Examples of [[Icon Based Visualization]] are:

- [[Star Plot]]
- [[Chernoff Faces]]
- [[Stick Figure Plot]]
