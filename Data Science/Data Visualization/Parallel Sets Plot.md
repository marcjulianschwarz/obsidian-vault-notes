# Parallel Sets Plot

Used to visualize [[Categorical Data]] in [[Multivariate Dataset]]. Find dependencies between variables ([[Korrelation|Correlation]]).
Kind of similar to [[Histogram]] but looks way better and has the benefit to show [[Korrelation|Correlation]].
Also similar to [[Parallel Coordinate Plot]] as this is the categorical counterpart.

## Interaction

- change column order
- change row order
- select rows
- hover to emphazise dependencies
