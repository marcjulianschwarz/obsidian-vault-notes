# Convolutional Neural Network

Multiple [[Convolution]] layers combined to form a network. They can learn abstract features and concepts from raw image pixels.

## Explanation Methods 

We can generate [[Explanation|Explanations]] for CNNs by doing [[Data Visualization]] of the learned features with **[[Activation Maximization]]**.
How can we be sure that the model actually understood the visualized concepts or whether it just remembered parts of the dataset?
