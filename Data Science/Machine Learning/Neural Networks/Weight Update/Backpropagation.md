# Backpropagation

The backpropagation algorithm uses the forward and backward flow of a [[Neural Network]] to efficiently calculate the [[Gradient|Gradients]] from the error function down to the individual weights. 

These gradients can the be used to update the weights in the direction of minimal error.
