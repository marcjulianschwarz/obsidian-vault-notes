# Recall

Number of correct classifications for a specific class divided by the total classifications of _that class_.

$$\frac{T}{total}$$

> [!Example]
> Explain it like fishing with a net. You use a wide net, and catch 80 of 100 total fish in a lake. That's 80% recall. But you also get 80 rocks in your net. That means 50% precision, half of the net's contents is junk. You could use a smaller net and target one pocket of the lake where there are lots of fish and no rocks, but you might only get 20 of the fish in order to get O rocks. That is 20% recall and 100% precision.
