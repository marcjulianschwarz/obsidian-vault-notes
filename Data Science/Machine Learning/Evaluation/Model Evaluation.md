# Model Evaluation

Use [[Performance Evaluation Metrics]] to evaluate the model on the validation set. Use the results to tune hyperparameters and repeat. The final evaluation will be calculated on the test set.

## Create Train, Validation and Test Sets

- [[Holdout Method]]
- [[K-Fold Cross Validation]]
- [[Leave-One-Out K-Fold Cross Validation]]
- [[Stratified K-Fold Corss Validation]]
- [[Bootstap]]
- [[Nested Cross Validation]]

## Evaluate Overfitting and Underfitting

- [[Learning Curve]]
- [[Validation Curve]]

## Tune Hyperparameters

- [[Validation Curve]]
- [[Grid Search]]
- [[Randomized Search]]
