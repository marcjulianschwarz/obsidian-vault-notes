# Validation Curve

A validation curve is similar to a [[Learning Curve]] but it is being used to estimate various [[Hyperparameters]] and not only the sample size. 

We can for example vary the [[Regularisation]] parameter of a [[Logistic Regression]] to see how much one should penalize for [[Overfitting]].
