# Cluster

A collection of [[Entity|Data Objects]] within a larger set that are [[Similarity|similar]] within the group and [[Dissimilarity|dissimilar]] to objects outside that group.

â†’ [[3. Postulate for Pattern Recognition|small intra-class distance and a high inter-class distance]]

The quality of a cluster depends on the [[Similarity]] measure usesd to create it. It might for example not be able to find some of the hidden patterns in the data.

Clusters can be found by doing [[Clustering]] on a [[Dataset]].
