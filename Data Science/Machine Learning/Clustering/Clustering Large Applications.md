# Clustering Large Applications

Can deal with larger datasets than [[k-means Clustering]] and [[k-medoids Clustering]] by applying [[k-medoids Clustering]] on each sample from random subset of dataset.

## Weakness

- efficiency depends on the sample size
- biased samples will lead to biased clustering
