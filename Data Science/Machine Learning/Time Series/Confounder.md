# Confounder

A variable that affects both the **dependent** and **independent** variables. Most of the times it has a causal effect on the variables and can thus not be directly recognized with [[Correlation Analysis]] / [[Korrelation|Correlation]].

The existence of confounding variables is an important explanation to why [[Correlation is not Causation]].
