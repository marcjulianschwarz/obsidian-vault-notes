# Open Dynamical System

A dynamical system can be called _open_ or _small_ when it does not include a complete world model. This means there are external factors that influence this system.

The time series input is some kind of _dynamical memory._

- [[Recurrent Neural Network]]
- [[State Space Model]]

[[Takens Theorem]] let's us model an [[Open Dynamical System]] as a [[State Space Model]].
