# Translucency

How much does the [[Explainable AI|XAI]] method depend on the internals of the [[Machine Learning|ML]] model (similar to [[Model-Agnostic]]).

The advantage of high translucency is that the method can rely on more information to generate explanations. The advantage of low translucency is that the explanation method is more [[Portability|portable]].

For example:

- LOW → [[LIME]]
- HIGH → [[Linear Regression]]
