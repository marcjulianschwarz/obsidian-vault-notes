# Ante-Hoc

[[Explainability|Interpretability]] is achieved by restricting the complexity of the model. For example by using models that are already interpretable like

- [[Decision Tree]]
- [[Linear Regression]]

You get a less performant model but not generally less accurate.
**BUT** you can be much more confident in the model.

First do something simple, then do something complex and achieve [[Explainability|Interpretability]] [[Post-Hoc]].
