# Pragmatic Analysis

Pragmatic analysis refers to the study of how context influences the interpretation of communication. It seeks to understand the intentions, beliefs, and assumptions of speakers or writers, how these are conveyed, and how they are understood by listeners or readers.

This analysis often involves understanding the social rules and conventions that influence the way individuals use language. For instance, the phrase "can you pass the salt?" is usually not understood as a question about someone's ability to pass the salt, but rather as a polite request for the salt to be passed. This interpretation is heavily influenced by pragmatic norms of politeness and indirectness.
