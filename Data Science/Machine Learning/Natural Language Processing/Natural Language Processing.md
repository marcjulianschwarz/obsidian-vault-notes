# Natural Language Processing

Processing [[Natural Language]] in a rather intelligent way. To let humans and [[Rational Agent|Agents]] communicate we need both [[Natural Language Understanding|NLU]] and [[Natural Language Generation|NLG]].

[[Natural Language Semantics]]

- [[NLP Abstraction]]
- [[NLP Ambiguity]]
- [[NLP Composition]]

We call a piece $i$ of information **linguistically realized** in an utterance $U$, iff, we can trace $i$ to a fragment of $U$.

When an utterance does not realize an information we can still infer it from the utterance or from world knowledge.

[[Pragmatic Analysis]]

What helps against wrong semantics is only a restricted domain. This means a restrictied [[Vocabulary]] and world model. For example SPARQL on DBPedia.

**Context is personal and keeps changing**
