# Binary Classification 

A [[Classification]] problem with only two classes.

[[Machine Learning|ML]] models that can solve this type of problem:
- [[Perceptron]]
- [[Adaptive Linear Unit|Adaline]]
- [[Logistic Regression]]
- [[Decision Tree]]


You basically want to calculate the [[Posterior Probability]]
$$F(y=0|x)$$
and
$$F(y=1|x)$$
for each sample $x$ where $y$ is the class.
