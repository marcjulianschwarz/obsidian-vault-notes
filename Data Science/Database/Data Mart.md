# Data Mart

In contrast to an [[Enterprise Warehouse]] data marts are only a subset of corporate-wide [[Dataset|data]] that is of value to a specific group of users.

A data mart can be dependent or independent of the [[Data Warehouse]] that is has been derived from.

It usually contains **highly** summarized data.
