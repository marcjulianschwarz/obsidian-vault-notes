# Mining Frequent Patterns, Associations and Correlations

Association Analysis
[[Correlation Analysis]]
Causality Analysis

Structural Patterns → [[Teilgraph|Subgraph]]

[[Classification]] → discriminative

### Concepts of Frequent Itemsets

You can use an [[Itemset]] and its corresponding [[Support]] and [[Confidence]] to find [[Association Rule|Association Rules]].
Every rule has a [[Support]] [[Confidence]] tuple.

There are too many possible [[Itemset|Itemsets]] for a [[Dataset]] thus you can reduce them with closed and max-itemsets.

### Scalable Frequent Itemset Mining Methods

The [[Downward-Closure Property]] is a tool used in the [[A priori - Frequent Item Approach]].

The [[Frequent Pattern Growth]] approach works differenty.
