> A startup's initial problem is usually what the product should be and how to get the first users. It may sound like those are two problems, but they're not. Ideally you solve them simultaneously, and the process of trying to get users shows you what the product should be.
> - Paul Graham


And you have to fully explore the problem and solution space for your specific problem. You want to be able to FULLY understand every tiny aspect of that space. Only then will you be able to build a product that can cover the entire space and does not miss out on important parts.
