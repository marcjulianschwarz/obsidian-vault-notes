# Linear Gaussian Model

This model assumes that the data has been "altered" by some random vector which is [[stochastisch unabh√§ngig|independent]] identically [[Normalverteilung|normally distributed]] with [[Erwartungswert|Expectation]] zero and some [[Varianz|Variance]] bigger than zero.

Then also the data is normally distributed which allows for construction of tests and [[Confidence Interval|confidence regions]] for parameters.

This model is (quite surprisingly for me now) robust against deviations from the [[Normalverteilung|Normal Distribution]].
