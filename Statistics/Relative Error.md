# Relative Error

Normalized and thus comparable for different $n$.
$$E_f(x, t):=\frac{1}{n}\|x-f(t)\|$$

Measures the **vertical distance** between data points. If both $x$ and $t$ contain errors, use [[Euklidische Norm|Euclidean Distance]] instead.

For [[Time Series Data]] a [[Dynamic Time Warping]] algorithm might be important.
