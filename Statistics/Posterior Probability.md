# Posterior Probability

Expresses the likelihood of an [[Ereignis|Event]] given some observed evidence and can be calculated with 
$$P(a\mid b)=\frac{P(a\land b)}{P(b)}$$

where $P(b) \neq 0.$

Intuition: The likelihood of having $a$ and $b$, within the set of [[Elementarereignis|Outcomes]] where
we have $b$.
