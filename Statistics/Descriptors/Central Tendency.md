# Central Tendency

To better understand the Central Tendency of a [[Dataset]] you can calculate various metrics like:

- [[Arithmetic Mean|Mean]], which is quite sensitive to [[Outlier]]
- Trimmed Mean, discards lowest and highest $\alpha$ percent of values. It is less sensitive to [[Outlier]]
- [[Median]]
- [[Modalwert]]
- [[Alpha-Trimmed Mean]]

With these metrics you can determine whether a [[Wahrscheinlichkeitsmaß|Distribution]] of [[Sample|Samples]] is skewed:
