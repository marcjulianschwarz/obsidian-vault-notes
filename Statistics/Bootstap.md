# Bootstap

Assume we don't know the underlying distribution of an estimator and/or we only have few values.
For example we have a small dataset and want to determine whether it is normally distributed or not and a [[qq-Plot]] is not convincing enough.

We can describe [[Standard Estimators]] with the [[Normalverteilung|Normal Distribution]] for large $n$ and use this fact to for example create a [[Confidence Interval]].

Samples training data uniformly with replacement.
