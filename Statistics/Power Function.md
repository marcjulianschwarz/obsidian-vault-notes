# Power Function

$$\mu \mapsto G(\mu):=\mathbb{P}_{\mu}\left(\text { reject } H_{0}\right) \quad\left(\mu \in H_{0} \cup H_{1}\right)$$
Probability that $H_0$ gets rejected based on some unknown $\mu$.

- $\alpha(\mu)$ is probability of [[Type 1 Error]] for $\mu$
- $\beta(\mu)$ is probability of [[Type 2 Error]] for $\mu$

_Power of the test:_ $1-\beta(\mu)$
