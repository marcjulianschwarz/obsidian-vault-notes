# Test Statistic

We calculate a test statistic on sampled data. Usually the distribution of a test statistic is either known or can be simulated. We can then use the distribution to find out which values are typical for the test statistic.

Used in:

- [[Gau√ü Test]]
- [[t-Test]]
- Binomial Test
- [[Chi-Squared Test]]
- [[Chi-Squared Test of Independence]]
- [[Shapiro-Wilk Test of Normality]]
- [[Lilliefors Test of Normality]]
- [[Kolmogorov Smirnov Test]]
