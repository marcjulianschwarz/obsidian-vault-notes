# Empirical Correlation Coefficient

The [[Korrelation|Correlation]] of a data sequence.
$$r(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{t})=\frac{c(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{t})}{\sqrt{V(\boldsymbol{x}) V(\boldsymbol{t})}}$$

with [[Sample Covariance]] and [[Sample Variance]].

> [!WARNING] Important
> It measures the **deviation** from linear dependence.

In the case of a [[Linear Regression]] the sign of the empirical correlation coefficient is the slope of the _regression line_.
