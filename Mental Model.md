> I think the main value I provide organizations is the ability to think holistically, from a product's core abstractions (the literal database schema), to how those are surfaced and interacted with by users, to how those are talked about by sales or marketing. Clear and consistent thinking across these dimensions is what makes some products "mysteriously" outperform others in the long run.


> This is an application of an engineering term to a product-level concept, but it fits. I guess you'd say "domain model" in product-speak, but to my engineering brain it doesn't evoke the cascading consequences of the model for the rest of the system. It's a rare product manager who treats the domain model as a consequential design product and a potential site of innovation.

> I decided that I should rewrite the system, as my mental model had improved and the code was doing a lot more than it should be doing for no reason. I've spent the last few days redesigning it according to Data-Oriented Design.
