# Cutset

A cutset is a subset of variables $V_{0}$ of a [[Constraint Satisfaction Problem|CSP]] if the sub-graph of the [[Constraint Graph]] induced by $V \text{\\} V_{0}$ has no [[Zyklus|Cycles]] (is acyclic).

The cutset is called **optimal** if its size (number of nodes $V_{0}$) is minimal among all other cutsets.
