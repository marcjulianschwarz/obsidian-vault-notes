# t-Test

Similar to [[Gauß Test]] but unkown [[Varianz|Variance]] is estimated using [[Sample Variance]]. We thus get [[t-Distribution]] which is approximating [[Normalverteilung|Normal Distribution]] for large $n$.

This test is also robust against deviations from normal distribution while Gauß Test has to have normal distribution.
