# Rational Behavior

- Always doing what is **expected** to **maximize** goal achievement given the available information.
- So within your current possibilities.
- Chooses [[Action|actions]] which maximize the expected value of the [[Performance Measure]], given the [[Percept]] sequence to date.
- Does not necessarily involve thinking (e.g. reflexes)
- Computational limits, unavailability of information, non-determinism make perfect rationality unachievable â†’ thus design best program for given resources
