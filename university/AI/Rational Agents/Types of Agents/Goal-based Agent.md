# Goal-based Agent

An [[Rational Agent|Agent]] (similar to [[Model-based Reflex Agent]]) whose [[Agent Function]] consists of a [[Transition Model]] which chooses [[Action|actions]] based on a set of goals and a world model.

This type of agent is a lot more flexible than a [[Model-based Reflex Agent]] or a [[Simple Reflex Agent]] as it can change the goals on the fly. For example choosing a new destination.
The other two mentioned agents can only go to exactly one destination.
