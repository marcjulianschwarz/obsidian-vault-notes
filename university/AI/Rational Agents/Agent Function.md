# Agent Function

A function $f_{a}$ of an [[Rational Agent|Agent]] $a$ maps from [[Percept]] histories to [[Action|actions]]:
$$f_a: \mathcal{P}^* \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$$
No multitasking (one action at a time). These functions can become very big and thus might not be computational.

An agent function that is computable can be implemented by an [[Agent Program]] that runs on a physical [[Agent Architecture]].
