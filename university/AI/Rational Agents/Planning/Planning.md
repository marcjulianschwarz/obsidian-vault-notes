# Planning 

So this is more or less a classical [[Search Problem]].

**Blackbox Description**
Here the [[Search Problem]] is an API providing functionality to construct the state space (with [[Action]], [[Transition Model]], etc.).

**Declarative Description**
Here the [[Search Problem]] comes in a [[Problem Description Language]] (Planning Language) which still allows us to implement an API, but we can do much more with this description.


[[Problem Description Language|Planning Language]] goes way beyond classical [[Search Problem]]:
- Natural Language Generation
- Business Process
- Automatic Hacking

- Greedy Best-First Search and A-star
- Heuristics for A-star

In practice, the [[Satisficing Planning]] problem is much more effective than [[Optimal Planning]].

Programs solving these problems are:
- Planning System
- Planner
- Planning Tool

- [[Sussman Anomaly]]
- [[STRIPS]]
- [[Partial Order Planning]]
- [[PDDL]]
