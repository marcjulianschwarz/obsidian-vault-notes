# Symbolic AI

Earliest approach to [[Artificial Intelligence]].

Assumes that many aspects of intelligence can be modelled by the manipulation of symbols. Symbols can be structured into expresions which can again be manipulated by processes to produce new expressions.

However Symbolic AI is very strictly defined and there are no uncertanties (unknowns). There is no randomness involved. [[Statistical AI]] wants to solve these two problems of Symbolic AI.
