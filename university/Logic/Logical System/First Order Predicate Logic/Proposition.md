# Proposition

A proposition is an object from the well-formed formulae of the [[First-Order Signature]] associated with the predicates. They denote truth values in the [[First-Order Predicate Logic]].

It is made up of:

- all predicates applied to maximum of $k$ well formed [[Terms]]
- the value true $T$
- if $A,B$ are propositions and $X$ is a [[Terms|Term]]
  - $A\land B$
  - $\neg A$
  - $\forall X.A$
    - $\forall$ is a binding operator called the [[Universal Quantifier]]
