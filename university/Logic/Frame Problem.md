# Frame Problem

We need to be able to represent actions in a way to not only describe their [[Effect|effects]] but also their non-effects on the static **frame of refernce**.

A solution would be to use Frame Axioms ([[Fluent|fluents]]) that are invariant under a given action.

This however would quickly lead to reasoning about huge amounts of things that dont actually change/matter.
