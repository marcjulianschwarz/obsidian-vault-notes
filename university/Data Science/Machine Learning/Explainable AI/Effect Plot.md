# Effect Plot

Utilizes both the weight from a model **and** the data distribution to calculate the [[Effect (XAI)]] of features on the target.

This is better than for example the [[Log Odds]] in a [[Logistic Regression]] model which will not consider the data [[Wahrscheinlichkeitsmaß|Distribution]].

The [[Effect Plot]] is a [[Global Explanation]]. We can make it local by plotting a single [[Effect (XAI)|Effect]] into the [[Wahrscheinlichkeitsmaß|Distribution]].
