# Disentangled Features

Features are disentangled when [[Neural Network]] learns features in a way such that each [[Unit]] detects a specific real world concept.

For example in [[Convolutional Neural Network|CNNs]] when channel 394 might detect skyscrapers, channel 121 dog snouts, channel 12 stripes at 30 degree angle.

This property would make it extremly easy to interpret [[Neural Network|Neural Networks]] by just looking at the most activating [[Unit]] and mapping it to its concept.
