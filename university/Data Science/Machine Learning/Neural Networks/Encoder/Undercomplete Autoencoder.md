# Undercomplete Autoencoder

A [[Unsupervised Learning]] [[Autoencoder]] that encodes unlabeled data and tries to predict (decode) to that same data.

Mostly used to generate the [[Latent Space]] which can be seen as a space that represents the data in lower dimensions ([[Dimensionality Reduction]]).

[[Principle Component Analysis]] can only recognize linear relationships and is thus not powerful enough to work with non-linear data. 

Uses the [[Reconstruction Loss]].
