# Unsupervised Learning

- implicit learning
- indirect feedback
- self-organizing (no labeled data)

## Clustering

[[Clustering]]
Identify similar samples and assign them with a label.
- [[k-means Clustering]]
- [[Gaussian Mixture Expectation Maximization]]
- [[Spectral Clustering]]
- [[Clustering mit Kruskal]]

## Dimensionality Reduction

[[Curse of Dimensionality]] → grows exponentaly.
Typical approaches:
- [[Feature Selection]]
- Feature Extraction (combine mutliple features into one) → [[Feature Engineering]]

For example:
- [[Principle Component Analysis]]
