# Hierarchical Clustering

A type of [[Clustering]] where the number of clusters is not required. But it needs a termination condition (which could also be the number of clusters).

It creates a hierarchical decomposition of the data.

Distances between [[Cluster|Clusters]] can be calculated in various ways:

- Minimum distance
  - minimum distance between an object in one cluster and an object in the other
- Maximum distance
  - maximum distance between an object in one cluster and an object in the other
- Average distance
  - average distance between an object in one cluster and an object in the other
- Mean distance
  - distance between the two centroids

[[Nearest Neighbors Algorithm]] uses minimum distance.
Single-linkage
MST
