# Clustering

Clustering is an [[Unsupervised Learning]] task which means that it is learning from observations and not from examples (data with labels).

It can be used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into data or as [[Data Preparation|Preprocessing]] step for other algorithms.

It works by partitioning [[Dataset|data]] based on [[Similarity]] and storing cluster representations like the centroid and diamater.

## Some Considerations

- Single Level vs. Hierarchical partitioning
- exclusive vs. non-exclusive
- distance vs. connectivity
- full space vs. subspaces
- scalability
- dealing with different [[Typen von Daten|Types of Data]]
- constraints by user and domain knowledge
- interpretability
- clusters with arbitrary shape
- deal with noisy data
- incremental clustering
- high dimensionality

## Major Approaches

- [[Partition-Based Clustering]]
- [[Hierarchical Clustering]]
- [[Density-Based Clustering]]
- [[Grid-Based Clustering]]

## Other Methods

- [[Clustering mit Kruskal]]
- [[Spectral Clustering]]
- [[Fuzzy K-Means Clustering]]

## Applications
