# Hierarchical Clustering using Dynamic Modeling

A [[Hierarchical Clustering]] method that works with really complex shapes of clusters.

Basic Algorithm Idea:

1. Use Graph-Partitioning Algorithm to cluster objects into a large number of small sub-clusters
2. Use an [[Agglomerative Nesting]] or similar algorithm to repeatedly merge these sub-clusters
