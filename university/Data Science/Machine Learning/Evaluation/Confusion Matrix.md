# Confusion Matrix

You can use a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of a [[Classification]] model.
Hypothesis classes (predicted) are the columns and the reference classes (true) are the rows.

However this might not be optimal when using it for a problem with a lot of classes.

You can determine [[Recall]] and [[Precision]] with a confusion matrix.
