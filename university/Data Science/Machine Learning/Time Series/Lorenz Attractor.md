# Lorenz Attractor

A kind of chaotic system which stems from a 2D fluid layer being warmed from below and cooled from above.

$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\sigma(y-x) \\
& \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} t}=x(\rho-z)-y \\
& \frac{\mathrm{d} z}{\mathrm{~d} t}=x y-\beta z .
\end{aligned}$$

We can generate 3 [[Time Series Data|sequences]] from this system by looking at the three axes.
