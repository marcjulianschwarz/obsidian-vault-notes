# Outlier

A [[Entity|Data Object]] that deviates **significantly** from normal data objects as if it was generated by a different mechanism or distribution.

> [!WARNING]+
> Outliers are **not** noise, thus noise has to be filtered out before doing any outlier detection.
> Also it is really important to always **justify** the removal or detection of an outlier. This could be done by specifying the degree of an outlier which means the unlikelihodd of the object being generated by a normal mechanism


There are different types of outliers which outliers can fall into. They are **not** restricted to only one of those types:

- Global (Point Anomaly)
- Contextual (Conditional Outlier / Local Outlier)
	- Deviates significantly based on a selected context 
	- Contextual Attributes vs. Behavioral Attributes 
- Collective Outlier 
	- A subset that collecitvely deviates significantly
	- Prior domain knowledge necessary

## Detection 

- [[Outlier Detection with Outlier Classification]]
	- [[Outlier Detection with Parametric Statistical Method]]
	- [[Outlier Detection with Non-Parametric Statistical Method]]
- [[Outlier Detection with Grouping Based on Assumptions]]
	- [[Distance-Based Outlier Detection]]
	- [[Density-Based Outlier Detection]]

Can also be a by-product of [[Clustering]] or [[Regression]] or Isolation Forest.

### Simple approaches 

Values higher or lower than 1.5 * [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]]
Values where [[Z-score]] is higher than 3.
