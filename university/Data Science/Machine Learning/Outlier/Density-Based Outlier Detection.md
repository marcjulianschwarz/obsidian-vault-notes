# Density-Based Outlier Detection

Can be used to detect local outliers by using their relative distance to their neighbors.

It is using the [[Reachability Distance]] and [[Local Outlier Factor]] to capture local outliers whose density is relatively low comparing to the local densities of its k neares neighbors.
