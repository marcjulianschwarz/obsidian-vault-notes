# Basis Function Expansion

With Polynomial regression we can fit a nonlinear relationship. 

We can do this by using a [[Linear Regression]] but applying a function before predicting the linear line. This function (or vector) is called the basis function.

Higher degree polynomials can express more complex relationships (But: [[Overfitting and Underfitting]]).
