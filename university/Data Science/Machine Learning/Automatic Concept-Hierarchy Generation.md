# Automatic Concept-Hierarchy Generation

Some [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] can be automatically generated by analysing the number of distinct/unique values per attribute where the attribute with the most values is at the lowest level and the one with the least values is the highest level.

_For example:_
streets → cities → states → countries

It is important to remember that one has to use [[Data Discretization]] for numerical data or otherwise the resulting hierarchy might not be accurate.
