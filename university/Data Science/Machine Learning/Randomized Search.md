# Randomized Search

Similar to [[Grid Search]] using [[K-Fold Cross Validation]] to tune [[Hyperparameters]]. But this time not from a fixed list of values but by sampling from a [[Wahrscheinlichkeitsma√ü|Distribution]] of values. 

The randomized search is not fixed to a grid and can thus find combinations that the [[Grid Search]] might have not found.
