# InfoVis Chapter 3.2 - Graph Visualization

Drawing a [[Graph]] means creating a graph [[Embedding]] of a graph on a surface.

The [[Wahrscheinlichkeitsma√ü|Distribution]] of nodes on the surface are determined by a [[Graph Layouts|Graph Layout]] which uses the property of [[Graph Isomorphism]] to visualize a Graph in different ways.

Information gained from [[Structure and Network Analysis]] can help to better visualize a graph and its underlying information.

## Visualization Techniques

- [[Adjazenzmatrix|Adjacency Matrix]]

You can also use different [[Graph Layouts]]:

- [[Random Graph Layout]]
- [[Circular Graph Layout]]
  - [[Circular Graph Layout Algorithm]]
- [[Radial Axis Graph Layout]]
- [[Dual Circular Graph Layout]]
- [[Force Directed Graph Layout]]
- [[Tree Graph Layout]]

## Other concepts

- [[Curved Edges]]
- [[Edge Bundling]]
