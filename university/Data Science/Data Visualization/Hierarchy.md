# Hierarchy

- A system in which entities are ranked one above each other.
- A [[Classification]] of entities following a **scheme of importance**
- One entity includes its children entities in a **containment hierarchy**

## Definitions

A Hierarchy is a [[Baum|Tree]] with:

- successor → child
- predecessor → parent
- root node
- leaves → node of degree 1
- inner nodes
- a tree level (length of path to root node)
- Out-[[Grad|Degree]] is number of children
- Siblings → same parent
- height of node (length of longest path to leave)
- depth of node (tree level, or length of path to root node)
- height of tree → height of root node or depth of deepest leaf node
- ordered tree → children have fixed left-to-right order
- subtrees are trees
- degree of tree is max degree of all nodes
- a tree is always [[Planarer Graph|Planar Graph]]
- binary tree → out degree at most 2
- [[Aufspannender Baum|Spanning Tree]]
- rooted tree
- directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- [[Wald|Forest]]
- [[MST-Algorithmus von Prim]], [[MST-Algorithmus von Kruskal]]
- [[Depth-first search]], [[Breadth-first search]] → pre-order, post-order, in-order
