# Chernoff Faces

I have NO idea why and when one should use these... lmao

Idea is that the human mind is able to distinguish facial features. These faces encode multiple dimensions.

Disadvantages are clear I guess.

- Seleciton of Mapping
- Interpretation of results
- symmetry introduces redundant information ([[Information Gain]] ?)
