# Data Mining in the ML and Statistics Community

In this [[ML Pipeline]] we go from a data input to [[Data Preparation]] which includes:

- [[Data Integration]]
- [[Normalization]]
- Feature Selection
- [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
- [[Data Cleaning]]
- [[Data Discretization]]
- ....

Now we can get to the Data Mining part of the pipeline which includes:

- [[MOC - Pattern Recognition]]
- [[Correlation Analysis]]
- [[Classification]]
- [[Clustering]]
- [[KDD Chapter 9 Outlier Analysis]]
- [[Linear Regression]] / [[Regression]]

Now as one of the last steps we have post processing which includes:

- Pattern Evaluation
- Selection
- Interpretation
- and important: [[Data Visualization]]

And all of the work done in the pipeline will result in some useful information or knowledge that was gained from the data.
