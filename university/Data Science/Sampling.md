# Sampling

Obtain a set of [[Sample|samples]] / subset from the whole [[Dataset]] that represents it really well.

It allows algorithms to run faster maybe even sub-linear.

## Methods

- random sampling â†’ may have poor performance in the presence of skew ([[Central Tendency]])
- [[Entity|sample]] without repetition
- [[Stratified Sampling]]
