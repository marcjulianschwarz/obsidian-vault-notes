# OLAP

Done on [[Datenbank|Databases]] constructed to support knowledge workers in decision making.
The databases are summarized in a [[Data Warehouse]] with [[Data Integration|integrated]] [[Multidimensionale Datenmodellierung|multidimensional]] and historical data.

Normally lots of scans, accessing a huge amount of records, are being done to do complex queries.
