# Ramseys Theorem

Given a [[Rational Behavior|rational]] set of [[Preferences]] there exists a real valued function $U$ (Utility function) such that 
$$U(A)\geq U(B)$$
iff $A\succeq B$ and 
$$U\left(\left[p_1, S_1 ; \ldots ; p_n, S_n\right]\right)=\sum_i p_i U\left(S_i\right)$$
The utility of a lottery is the [[Expected Utility]] of all of the individual states with their probabilities.

This function is not unique. For example positive linear transformations will not change the function in a meaningful way.
