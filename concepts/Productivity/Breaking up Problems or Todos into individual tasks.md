1. Start with a list of tasks – or just one big project!
2. Think through the steps you’d need to take to accomplish that task, and write them down. Don’t worry about completeness or accuracy or depth, each pass just needs to expand, even slightly, on the previous one.
3. Is every task on your new list sufficiently defined? (I’ll define “sufficiently” in a minute.) If not, GOTO 1.

What is a complete task? Answer all following questions with YES:
- what change is desired?
- how does done look like?
- can all steps to achieve "done" be defined?
- do I have all information to start?
