> No Abstraction is better than Bad Abstraction 

Got the quote from somewhere but I don't remember where.

Why our software is so terrible:
[Handmade Manifesto | Handmade Network](https://handmade.network/manifesto)

We ship thousands of dependencies to our users to save ourselves a few minutes of effort. We build towers of abstractions, forget how they work, and then build new ones on top.

When your understanding of the context stabilizes, there's value in throwing away vast swathes of a program, and redoing it from scratch.
