Notes from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY.

• No jargon
• Shorter words
• Write how you talk
• Check quotations
• Read "Writing That Works"
• Give writing time to breathe

Quality of Speaking is determined by:
1. Knowledge 
2. Practice 
3. Talent 

## Start 

1. Do not start a talk with a joke. 
2. Promise - Tell them what they gonna learn at the end of your talk. 
3. Cycle – make your idea repeated many times in order to be completely clear for everyone. 
4. Make a “Fence” around your idea so that it can be distinguished from someone else’s idea. 
5. Verbal punctuation – sum up information within your talk some times to make listeners get back on.
6. Ask a question - intriguing one, wait for an answer (max 7 seconds)

## Place and Time 

- Best time for having a lecture is 11 am. (not too early and not after lunch)
- Well lit place
- Seen and checked before the lecture → **Cased**
- Not be full less than a half, it must be chosen according to the amount of listeners. → **Populated**

## Tools 
### For teaching
- Board – it’s got graphics, speed, target. 
- Watch your hands! Don’t hold them behind your back, it’s better to keep them straight and use for pointing at the board.
- Props – use them in order to make your ideas visual. Visual perception is the most effective way to interact with listeners. 

### For Job Talk. Exposing, Slides 
- [[Empathatic Mirroring]] → Advantage over slides 
- Don’t put too many words on a slide. Slides should just reflect what you’re saying, not the other way around. Pictures attracts attention and people start to wait for your explanation – use that tip. 
- Make slide as easy as you can – **no title, no distracting pictures, frames, points and so on.** 
- Do not use laser pointer – due to that you lose eye contact with the audience. Laser Pointer Crime. Instead you can make the arrows just upon a slide. 
- Use big font sizes 
- Dont make slide too heavy → leave some air (e.g. slides without lots of text in between)
- Hapax legomenon


### Informing 
Show to your listeners your stuff is cool and interesting by showing passion for the subject.

You have to be able to (how to hold a technical talk): 
- show your vision of a problem (upfront), what makes your approach new 
- show that you’ve done particular things (by steps, "here is what needs to be done", realize the vision) 
- enumerate your contributions 

→ All of that should be done real quick in no more than 5 min. 

Persuade your listeners you’re not a rookie (Prof. Winston contrived to do that from the very first seconds of his talk) 

### Getting Famous / Make your work get recognized

If you want to your ideas be remembered you’ve got to have "5 S" 

- Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention) → e.g. logos, icons, etc.
- Slogan (describing your idea)
- Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you’ve told about it)
- Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)
- Story (how you did it, how it works…) 

## How to End

- Don’t put collaborators at the end, do that at the beginning. 
- Question’s the **worst** possible way to end a talk. 
	- better tell people who you are 
- It’s good to end with a Contribution (own contributions to the problem) slide
- to sum up everything you’ve told with your OWN decision.
- At the very end you could tell a joke since people then will leave the event feeling fun and thus keep a good memory of your talk.
- "Thank you (for listening)" isn’t good ending, it’s trite at least. You can end with a quote of a prominent person (my own knowledge), with a salute to people (how much you valued the time being here, the people over here..., “I’d like to get back, it was fun!” 

That part actually I find the hardest one, since saying “Thanks” is a kind of a habit and it’s really difficult to make people clap if your talk wasn’t fascinating, so you’d better do this great and you won’t have to worry about how to end!
